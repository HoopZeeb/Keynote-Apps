This example shows you how to build a self-updating Google spreadsheet that displays your Keynote performance data. The JavaScript functions will take a blank worksheet and populate it with a table of performance data for all of the Keynote measurements slots visible to your API key. For those of you familiar with MyKeynote, this is the same data found in the Dashboards tab. This includes the following information for each measurement slot:

-Average total network time over the last 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour and 24 hours
-Average availability over the last 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour and 24 hours 

Please note that this will also work with Google Drive if you have converted to that product from Google Docs.
